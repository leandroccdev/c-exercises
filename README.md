Exercises written in C

##### Documentation conventions
This repo uses the doxygen conventions to documenting C code. You can read it [here](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.htmlhttps://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html).

##### Why this repo?
I do not program in C very often, and after a while i forget what i've learned.
This helps me keep it in memory. Also, it help me to pass the time. It's fun.
